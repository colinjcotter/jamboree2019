This data is obtained from a 2D simulation of an incompressible
fluid. The data consists of measurements of the x- and y-components of
the fluid velocity over 9998 time steps, measured at 81 locations in
the domain arranged in a 9x9 grid.

The data is stored in .csv files in this directory, one per Cartesian
component, with each line corresponding to the values at the 81
measurement points at one time step.

THE CHALLENGE FOR THIS DATASET

This data set is the first half of a longer dataset. Your challenge is
to provide forecasts for the measurements at the observation locations
at three later timesteps of your choice. You should also quantify your uncertainty in this
estimate by:
* providing a variance that is the same for all of the values, or
* providing a different variance value for each observation station, or
* providing a covariance matrix, or
* by providing one of the above separately for each component.

The score for each prediction will be proportional to the negative
log-likelihood of the true value given your prediction
i.e. proportional to

(u - u_T)^T\Sigma_u^{-1}(u-u_T) + (v - v_T)^T\Sigma_v^{-1}(v-v_T)

where \Sigma_u and \Sigma_v are the covariance matrices for the
uncertainty in your estimate for u and v respectively (we will
construct a diagonal matrix from your individual variances if you use
those), u and v are the 81-dimensional vectors containing your
predictions of the velocity components.

We will then multiply the score for each prediction by the lead time for
it i.e. the number of timesteps into the future from the provided data
set that you are predicting, before summing. 

You should submit your predictions by 3pm Tuesday 19th March by adding
the data to a public fork of this repository on Github (the same fork
should be used for all three challenges in your group) and sending the
SHA of the commit to colin.cotter@imperial.ac.uk.
